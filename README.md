# Excel-SocialBuzz

Tasks:
1.Identify which datasets will be required to answer the clientâ€™s business question
2.Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis
3.Determine the answer to the clientâ€™s business question

Problem:
1.Every day, Social Buzz receives over 100,000 posts, totaling 36,500,000 posts annually. Since all of the content is unstructured, it might be challenging to make sense of it all.
2.Combining tables from the sample data set
3.An analysis of their content categories that identifies the top five with the highest total popularity


During the simulation:
 
- Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover valuable insights into content trends using excel 
- Create a final data set by merging your three tables together using VLOOKUP
- Figure out the Top 5 performing categories by Adding up the total scores for each category using SUMIF
- Leveraged my data analysis skills to identify patterns and understand user behavior
- Prepared a compelling PowerPoint deck

 Insights: ðŸ’¡
1. Total of 16 unique categories of posts across sample dataset. This includes things such as Food, Science and Animals
2. top 5 most popular categories of posts were animals, science, healthy eating, technology and food in descending
3. Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965.
4. Healthy eating ranks slightly higher than food, so perhaps your user base may be skewed towards healthy
eaters and health-conscious people.
